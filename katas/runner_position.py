To complete this exercise:
--------------------------
You have a list of runners in the order they finished the race. 
Your job is to determine the position of a particular runner based on their name.
If the runner did not finish the race, you should return -1.


Exercise Breakdown:
-------------------
There is a function to do it: list.index(). But try to do it manually using loops.

The `list.index()` method is a built-in Python function that returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a list. 
If the value is not found, it raises a `ValueError` error.
