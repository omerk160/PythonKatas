To complete this exercise:
--------------------------
Assume that the last part of the path is always a file and not a folder.


Exercise Breakdown:
-------------------
The `str.split(delimiter)` function allows you to break a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.
If no delimiter is specified, str.split(), the default is whitespace.
