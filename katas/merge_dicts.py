"""
To complete this exercise:
--------------------------
Ensure that when there are keys present in both dictionaries, the values from `dict2` override the values from `dict1`.


Exercise Breakdown:
-------------------
Merging dictionaries is a common task, and there are several methods available to do this

- The `update()` method to merge `dict2` into `dict1`.
- The unpacking operator `**` to merge dictionaries into a new dictionary.
