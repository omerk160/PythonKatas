class Dog:
    """
    The Dog class has a constructor (__init__) that initializes the name and breed attributes of the class.
    It also has two methods: bark(), which prints a simple bark message,
    and describe(), which prints the dog's name and breed.

    1. In the constructor, create a new attribute called `self.position` which defines the position state of the dog.
       The attribute possible values are: sitting, standing, jumping. Default is sitting.
    2. Implement the following methods: sit(), stand(), jump(). Each method changes the position of the dog.
    3. Extend the bark() function to receive an argument called `n` with default values of 2, the god should bark n times.
    4. Add the dog position to the description printed in describe method. E.g.: `I'm John, a Puddle. I'm standing.`
